# CCNA & CCNP Labs Compilation

Welcome to the CCNA & CCNP Labs repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive compilation of step-by-step lab configurations for **CCNA** and **CCNP** certifications. It gathers resources from various platforms to provide a centralized location for your study and practice needs.

## Sources

The labs included in this repository are sourced from:
*   **NetAcad** (Cisco Networking Academy)
*   **Cisco Books** (Official Cert Guides and Lab Manuals)
*   **PNET Lab** (Free labs and workbooks from the PNET Lab store)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized first by certification level, then by source, and finally by chapter or lab number.

```

Inside each source folder, you will find labs organized by chapter or specific lab topics (e.g., `OSPF`, `BGP`).

## Supported File Formats

This repository contains various file types to assist with your labs:
*   **Lab Files**: `.pkt` (Packet Tracer), `.gns3` (GNS3), `.unl` (EVE-NG / PNETLab)
*   **Documentation**: `.pdf` (Lab manuals, instructions)
*   **Visuals**: Images (diagrams, topologies)

## Prerequisites & Software Requirements

To make the most of these labs, you will need one or more of the following simulation/emulation tools:

*   **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For `.pkt` and `.pka` files.
*   **GNS3**: For `.gns3` projects.
